## Shell

* atuin

_zsh_autosuggest_strategy_atuin() {
    suggestion=$(atuin search --cmd-only --limit 1 --search-mode prefix $1)

  * navigate up a directory (see [comment](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/3159#issuecomment-1424575660). something like `--bind 'backward-eof:reload(__fzf "$(pwd)/.." $2)'`

## Editor

## Terminal emulator

* fix kitty bold/italic [autodetection](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/blob/master/kitty/fonts/fontconfig.py) for SourceCodePro
* better scrollback pager for kitty
  * try using `page`
  * maybe just write to /tmp and open
  * see [related issue](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/719#issuecomment-952039731) and [nvim plugin](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim)

  * look into opentype options with opentype.dev or other fonts:
    * dejavu victor menlo/meslo fira hack hasklig isoveka jetbrains mononoki ubuntu berkely (and check chat thread from work for others)
  * use the nixos fontconfig options and grabbing the resulting xml osConfig for home-manager instead of hand-writing the whole thing

## Theme

Currently I'm trying out using catppuccin-mocha-pink everywhere I can manage, though a lot of stuff is still vaguely gruvbox. This [darcula config](https://github.com/addy419/configurations/blob/master/modules/colorschemes/dracula.nix) is a good reference of stuff that can be themed.

* fix [rounded corner issue](https://github.com/catppuccin/gtk/issues/129)
* rofi
* qt (kvantum) seems broken currently, see sioodmy's config
* imhex
* firefox homepage and/or userstyles
* cursor maybe? also try qogir and graphite
* i3/i3status
* hyprland/ironbar
* swaync
* nvim
* [obsidian](https://github.com/catppuccin/obsidian)
* kitty/wezterm/rio
  * does terminal emulator cover most stuff, or will eza/htop/etc. need additional config?

## Other

* rust share target dir with [targo](https://github.com/sunshowers/targo)
* powertop handle kitty terminfo
* tlp fix locale issue
* ruff use human readable config names [once that's an option](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1773)
* git
  * ssh key commit signing
  * use an actual difftool like nvimdiff/fugitive/gnome meld/etc.
* nss doesn't work for stuff like `htop` and `eza` in home-manager on my work computer, running the system's version of `nscd` seems to fix it but that service keeps going down.
* try xplr/joshuto
* htop config param for number of cores, add io screen once [this](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/pull/3846) gets merged
* j don't create dir in `$HOME`, also grab an older version while it's broken (i think due to the llvm 16 bump?)
* typst-lsp broken
* mod+o use rofi file completion starting from ~ and xdg-open
* usbtop needs pcap settings
* fontfor broken

## Nix stuff

* don't expose packages if `meta.platforms != system`, currently I use excludes in `garnix.yaml` for this
* Upstream the nixGL wrapper I use
* add a custom livedisk flake output
* add a vm flake output
* export home/nixos modules separately from hosts, use a layout like [misterio's starter config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs/blob/main/standard/flake.nix)
* my `warnIfUpdated` util function seems broken, though I could have sworn it worked at one point. I might be missing something about how evaluation caching works (I've noticed that other home-manager warnings only show up a single time after I `nix flake update` )
* pull out into redistributable home-manager module
* profile flake eval time, see [this thread](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-flamegraph-or-profiling-tool/33333)
* use flake registry to make local devshells update to my system config's pinned nixpkgs version

## NixOS stuff
* use impermanence and make root ephemeral, see [example](https://git.sr.ht/~misterio/nix-config/tree/main/item/hosts/common/optional/ephemeral-btrfs.nix) and [guide](https://mt-caret.github.io/blog/posts/2020-06-29-optin-state.html).
* post processing to get useful output out of: `sudo btrfs send --no-data -p /blank / | btrfs receive --dump`
* maybe create a snapshot right after boot and then diff it upon shutdown, possibly saving a snapshot with whatever new files exist before they get wiped on the next reboot. btrfs subvolume find-new might be the thing
* `fd . / --mount -tf` is also maybe enough?
* consider whether impermanence is even worth the hassle if it's just for root, do I want to try using it in `$HOME` too? seems like more trouble than it's worth at the moment...
* make sure zsh gets completions and bash completions (fwupdmgr) from system packages

## little tools/scripts/patches I should write

* Something like [nvd](https://gitlab.com/khumba/nvd) with some additional features:
  * total size diff of closure
  * gives dateâ†’date and try to pull out git hashes to make that link to the diff
  * Should be possible given that it's being automated [here](https://github.com/EdenEast/nyx/pull/101) by [this action](https://github.com/EdenEast/nyx/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr.yml).
    * put it in `system.activationScripts.diff`
        * do the same for `home.activation.diff` unless under nixos
* Ask rahul about the sqlite thing (possibly the one mentioned [here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-channel-scripts/issues/45)) as a potential alternative to nix-locate. I'd really like to have a search experience on the command line that's as good as the online one:
  * prioritization and filtering on pname/binary/description/files in package/etc.
  * show packageSets
  * link to source definition in nixpkgs (the one in my nix store if possible? that won't have git history though... maybe point it at a local nixpkgs checkout if it exists and otherwise link to github)
  * extra info such as NAR size, closure size, diff of closure with current system if that's doable, version, last updated date, etc.
  * the [command-not-found rust rewrite](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-index/pull/227) could be a good example
* pokedex neofetch on shell startup
* cat motd
* prettier lsp log viewer for nvim (see [issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/16807))
* numbat
  * implement `-> fraction` with [this functionality](https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat/issues/202)
  * get oC and oF working
  * -> hex/octal/binary
  * k for thousands
  * currency fetch cache window
  * write rofi script
  * support for precise rationals and pretty-printing answers as proper fractions
  * set default unit for kinds of quantity (for example J or calorie for energy)
  * look into symbolic algebra
* fuzzy select browser tab and focus it, maybe just firefox extension improving ctrl+shift+a
  * order by history of focus by default
* package asm-lsp and add goto def functionality
  * maybe improve the data scraping bit too
* btm add scrolling dots for active task like btop

## Games

* slippi + kernel module + skins? see [ssbm-nix](https://github.com/djanatyn/ssbm-nix)
* [hsdlib](https://github.com/rrbutani/HSDLib) and xdelta for modding
* everest for celeste, r2modman for ror2, the ftl mod manager, etc.
* use flatpak for fightcade
* minecraft + mods, maybe use [nix-minecraft](https://github.com/Infinidoge/nix-minecraft)

* sabaki sgf viewer
* shattered-pixel-dungeon or maybe just steam version
* ruffle or that other one I used on windows for flash stuff

* gunz the duel
* itch check wine setup
* ludosavi check which games aren't covered, set up periodic backups
* rhythm doctor and that one from itch.io, check that it works while floating
* asciiportal
* OG elite or more modern remake in the spirit of it
* pokefinder + timer and assorted tools
* hoyle boardgames + fantastic contraption

## `pkgs/`

* `butter`
  * follow the [upstream instructions](https://github.com/zhangyuannie/butter/blob/main/BUILDING.md). Does the fact that they drive the rust build with meson/ninja mean that I can't use the usual nixpkgs rust infrastructure?
  * ensure that systemd timers it creates actually get triggered, is the service user or system level?
  * remove garnix exclude once it's working

## Hosts
